A platform for a specific blockchain gaming community where they could track all of their assets whether in-game or on the blockchain. It became quite a popular tracker for community members, amassing up to 168k users

## Context

In the explosion of interest in cryptocurrencies in 2020-2021, combined with the COVID-19 pandemic keeping the majority of people indoors and unemployed, blockchain games became quite popular in the Philippines as it allowed people to earn cryptocurrencies as rewards which they can later on trade for real money just for playing a game.

Axie Infinity was the most popular blockchain game where you could buy, sell and breed digital creatures called "axies," which are represented as NFTs. They can then use these creatures to play the game, allowing them to earn tokens which they can then trade for real money. People who had the financial capabilities to buy "axies" would sometimes lend these creatures to other people and let them play the game, they would just have to split the rewards. This gave birth to the game's scholarship system. The community refers to the people who own and lend axies as "managers" and people who play/borrow with the lender's axies as "scholars"
